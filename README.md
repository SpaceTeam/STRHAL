# Firmware for Liquids Projects

This Repository contains the STM32CubeIDE project of the Liquid Firmware, that consists of the main C++ Application, the can_houbolt submodule and the STRHAL submodule. The main application interfaces to the [LL Server](https://github.com/SpaceTeam/llserver_ecui_houbolt) via FDCAN and the can_houbolt interface imported as a submodule in Core/Inc. To avoid using the HAL and gain more insight and control over the hardware, a custom hardware abstraction layer using only CMSIS and LL, STRHAL, was written and imported as a submodule in Drivers/STM32xxxx/STRHAL, where each supported STM32 variant contains the STRHAL repo with the respective branch. For each supported STM32 variant a build configuration has to be added that includes the correct Drivers folder.
